A friend invited me to go to a sauna. However, I'm really hesitant about getting naked in front of others. It's one thing to be shirtless, but being completely naked is extremely embarrassing. Still, he's invited me several times, and each time I refuse, he seems disappointed. That must mean there's something alluring about saunas.

I've never been to one, and being picky without trying can limit your life experiences and lead to missing out. Given how often he's asked, I started thinking it might be good for my life to at least try it once. I've often heard that experiencing new things can change your perspective. Moreover, if it were an invitation from someone I'm not that close to, it would be one thing, but since it's from a good friend, turning it down could mean I'd never experience a sauna in my lifetime, which might be a waste. Precisely because it's an invitation from a close friend, it feels like a chance to seize, even if I'm not keen on it.

So this time, I decided to accept the invitation. As a result, I might discover something new, realize I'm not as uncomfortable exposing myself in front of others as I thought, or confirm that I still don't like it. But all of this is part of the "experience." Without experiencing it, I won't even know if I truly dislike it — it's like Schrödinger's cat. I might just be imagining things. Living a life repeating such assumptions would surely be dull. So this time, I'm choosing to step out of my comfort zone.
