I was invited to a sauna by a friend.

However, I still have strong reservations about being naked in front of others. Being just topless is one thing, but being fully naked is the ultimate in embarrassment. Despite this, I've been invited several times by this friend, and he seems genuinely disappointed every time I decline. There must be something very appealing about saunas.

Since I've never experienced it, I might be limiting my life's scope by rejecting it without trying, thus missing out on potential benefits. Given how insistent he has been, maybe it's a good idea for my life to give it a try at least once. You often hear that experiencing new things can change your worldview. Moreover, if it were an invitation from someone I'm not close to, it would be different, but this is a close friend. If I refuse, I might miss my only chance to experience a sauna, which would be quite a shame. The fact that it's an invitation from a good friend suggests it’s an opportunity to try something I might not be comfortable with.

So this time, I've decided to accept the invitation. As a result, I might discover something new, realize that being exposed in front of others isn't as bad as I thought, or confirm that I really don't like it. Regardless, it's all part of the "experience." Without trying, I can't truly know if I dislike it or not. It's like Schrödinger's cat. Perhaps I'm just imagining it all in my head. A life filled with such repetitions would likely be a limited one. So this time, I'm going to boldly step out of my comfort zone.
